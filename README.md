# Interesting Resources for All
An ongoing list of interesting resources (including softwares, programs, websites, articles, forums, discussions, etc.) that I want to keep track of. This was inspired by this [awesome](https://github.iu.edu/dmreagan/awesome-avl?tab=readme-ov-file) list created by my friend David Reagan.

# Indiana University

# 3D Printing
- [FilamenColors](https://filamentcolors.xyz/library/): A repository of filaments that showcase what the colors actually look 3D printed to compare.
# Photogrammetry & 3D Scanning
