# Interesting Resources for All
An ongoing list of interesting resources (including softwares, programs, websites, articles, forums, discussions, etc.) that I want to keep track of. This was inspired by this [awesome]([url](https://github.iu.edu/dmreagan/awesome-avl?tab=readme-ov-file)) list created by my friend David Reagan.

# 3D Printing
